## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented based on William Fiset's data structure course:

- [Dynamic Array](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Data_Structures/Static_and_DynamicArrays)
- [Linked List](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Data_Structures/Singly_and_Doubly_LinkedLists)
- [Stack](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Data_Structures/Stacks)
- [Queue](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Data_Structures/Queue)
- [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Data_Structures/Binary_Trees_and_Binary_Search_Trees)
- [Balanced Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Data_Structures/Balanced_Binary_Search_Trees)
- [Heap](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Data_Structures/Priority_Queue)
- [Fenwick Tree](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Data_Structures/Fenwick_Trees)
- [Hash Table](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Data_Structures/Hash_Tables)
- [Indexed Priority Queue](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Data_Structures/Indexed_Priority_Queue)
- [Union Find](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Data_Structures/Union_Find)

William Fiset's implementations in Java can be found in his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms).

## Algorithms

In addition to data structures, I've also implemented various algorithms, including but not limited to:

- [Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Algorithms/sort)
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Bubble Sort
- [Search Algorithms](https://github.com/akpax/DataStructures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/Algorithms/search)
  - Binary Search
  - Depth-First Search
  - Breadth-First Search
- [Graph Algorithms](path/to/graph-algorithms) -- CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
  - Prim's Algorithm
- [Dynamic Programming](path/to/dynamic-programming) -- CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS
  - Fibonacci Sequence
  - Longest Common Subsequence
